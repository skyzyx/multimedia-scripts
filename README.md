# Multimedia Scripts

I have media files. I do some multimedia processing, and these scripts help me stay organized.

You can use these to write Automator-based services, for example.

## Points of note

* I only work with MP4 containers, so these are designed to work for that.
* I am assuming you're putting metadata into your media files with [Subler](https://subler.org) or a similar tool.
* I have installed [Bash 4 on my Mac](https://github.com/skyzyx/bash-mac), and some of these scripts _may_ use Bash 4 features.

## Prerequisites

* [SublerCLI](https://bitbucket.org/galad87/sublercli)
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
* Install the `Brewfile`
